#  Thmanya Task

## About Solution
- This app is built using SwiftUI, Async/Await And MVVM Structure.
- Creating Dynamic content is implemented based on Content Type, Not basd on Indexes "Which means if you shuffled the order from APIs, UI Will also adapt!"
- Making Sections As a reusable Componenets in order to use them in many screens like (Main & Search Screen)

## Challanges:
- Making a dynamic Content with Dynamic Data types in the very same value array
    - To be honest, It wasn't Challaning :D I made it w times before, While Building Catalog in Sary App, And while creating Dynamic Forms in Cerqel (While working in Youxel)
- Making App in Arabic
    - Since the Whole Content is comming from API, I tried to inspect the API, Adding language parameter to headers and as a quey parameter, But with No luck.. So It is in English :(
- Search!
    - The shared API wasn't helpful, Just reutrn mock data, and this data is not valid to build the UI, plus it doesn't do any search. So I ignored the API and made the search Screen using the main page API (Since there is no search result from API :D) But you will like it!

 ## Suggestions
 - Sharing better resources will make implementation faster! (Ex: Figma design, APIs with data close to mentioned design "Arabic Response")
